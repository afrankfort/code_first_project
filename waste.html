                        <br> <br> When you are not at home you can say no to plastic products like straws, cups and cutlery.
                        <br><br>When shopping, try to avoid food that has excessive packaging and buy detergents in bulk. There are now lots of places where you can get refills for these too!</small>

                                              <li>Many fabrics contain chemical dyes which include lead, formaldehyde, pesticides and carcinogens which are dumped into local waterways and pollute areas around factories
                                                <li>11% of the words pesticides are used just on cotton
                                                  <li>To keep competitive, low prices, companies chase the cheapest labour. Unsuprisingly, only local law applies to these factories, so low pay, unsafe conditions and no rights are common.
                                                    <li>The average fast fashion item goes from store to landfill within a year

                                                          <ol>
                                                            <li>If you end up with something you don't want or need, don't feel guilty, give it to a charity like Help Refugees.
                                                              <li>Give that pile of excess toiletries stacked away in your bathroom to a homeless charity.
                                                                <li>Before throwing away electronics or furtniture, look up what your counsel suggests you could do in your area. For example, many charity shops will pick up your furniture for free, and afterschool projects could use your craft supplies.
                                                                  <li>Treat fixing things like the skill it is. It is very useful and valuable so offer to help friends out if you can fix something they want to throw away.
                                                                    <li>Biodegradable products take longer to break down than food scraps so consider this when putting them in your compost. When in doubt, look up how they suggesting disposing of their product.
                                                                      <li>Save used jars and use them for storage. They are great for keeping soups and sauces in the fridge, make-up brushes and candels.
                                                                        <li>Before you throw something away, have a think or a google to see if you can use it for something else practical or crafty.
                                                                          <li> Shop on zero waste websites like Plastic Freedom or Zero Waste Club.

Shop locally, go to charity shops, do clothes swaps with your friends and try to support transparent brands who have sustainable supply chains. You could also learn to upcycle clothes by editing items that don't fit, embellishing with different farbics or making it into someting else all together!</small>
