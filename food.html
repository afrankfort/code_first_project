            <small><ol>
              <li> Plan meals, buy online what you need (be honest)
                <li> Buy odd looking fruit and veg
                  <li> Put older products at the front of the fridge
                    <li> Write down everything you throw away in one week to see what you need less of
                      <li> Plan meals around products that are going off
                        <li> Have one meal away where you challenge yourself to only eat leftovers
                          <li> Use all bits of the plant
                            <li> Get some airtight containers or use old jars to store food properly
                              <li> Repurpose scraps in stock or look up another recipe to use them up
                                <li> Donate tins you won't eat to a food
                                  <li> Start a compost pile for your fruit and veg scraps and you will have your own nutrient rich soil for the garden
                                    <li> See if your counsel has a food bin service for cooked or proccessed food that can't be composted

                                          Try to use a container that is a similar shape to the food you are trying to grow <br>

                                          The meat and diary industry has many negative effects on the envrionement from carbon emmisions to resource wasting to deforestation. Reducing your meat and milk intake is the most effective way you can lower your negative envrionmental impact.
                                          To prevent the exploitation of animals <br>
                                          It is good for your health - a plant-based diet can reduce the risk of many diseases such as diabetes and hear problems. It can also help you loose weight and improve the quality of your skin. <br>
                                          It's a great time to give it a go - there are so many new plant-based options and recipes available, now is the best time to give it a go. <br>
